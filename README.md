Hi! Thanks for reading my profile README. I'm Brodie and I'm the owner of this account.

Status Update: Brushing up on my programming/coding skills to prepare for a MS in Data Science at Indiana University (application submitted Oct 11, 2022)

This is a work-in-progress currently because my GitHub account is still new. 
I'm going to set the basics of my profile README right now, but it will be 
mostly empty until I get some more projects under my belt.
